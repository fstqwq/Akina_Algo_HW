\section*{Matching LP and Vertex Cover LP}



Let $G=(V,E)$ be a 
graph and consider the Vertex Cover Linear Program $\textrm{VCLP}(G)$:
\begin{align*}
\textrm{VCLP($G$)}: \qquad
\begin{array}{lrl}
\textnormal{minimize} \quad & \multicolumn{2}{l}{\sum_{u \in V} y_u} \\
\textnormal{subject to} \quad & y_u + y_v  & \geq 1 \quad \forall\ \textnormal{ edges } \{u,v\} \in E\\
& \y & \geq \mathbf{0}  
\end{array}
\end{align*}
Every vertex cover of $G$ corresponds to a feasible solution $\y \in \sol(\textrm{VCLP}(G))$, but not 
vice versa. However, every $\y \in \sol(\textrm{VCLP}(G)) \cap \{0,1\}^V$ does.
Let $\tau(G)$ denote the size of a minimum vertex cover of $G$. In class, we showed that
$\tau(G) = \val(\textrm{VCLP}(G))$ for all {\em bipartite} graphs $G$. We achieved this by taking
an arbitrary feasible solution $\y$ and ``shaking'' it until it becomes integral, while making sure
its value does not go up.\\


Next, recall the Matching Linear Program $\textrm{MLP}(G)$:
\begin{align*}
\textrm{MLP($G$)}: \qquad
\begin{array}{lrl}
\textnormal{maximize} \quad & \multicolumn{2}{l}{\sum_{e \in E} x_e} \\
\textnormal{subject to} \quad & \sum_{e \in E: u \in e} x_e  & \leq 1 \quad \forall\ u \in V \\
& \x & \geq \mathbf{0}  
\end{array}
\end{align*}
Every matching of $G$ corresponds to a feasible solution $\x \in \sol(\textrm{MLP}(G))$, but not 
vice versa. However, every $\x \in \sol(\textrm{MLP}(G)) \cap \{0,1\}^E$ does.

\begin{problem}{1}
	\statement
   Let $\nu(G)$ denote the size of a maximum matching of $G$. 
   Obviously, $ \val(\textrm{MLP}(G)) \geq \nu(G)$ for all graphs.
   Show that
   $\nu(G) = \val(\textrm{MLP}(G))$ for all {\em bipartite} graphs $G$.
   
    \solution
    
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{2}
  \statement
 We know that $\nu(G) = \tau(G)$ for all bipartite graphs 
        and $\nu(G) \leq \tau(G)$ for all graphs (since every matched edge must
        be covered by a distinct vertex). Show that $\tau(G) \leq 2 \nu(G)$ for all graphs G.
  
  \solution
  
  Let \(M\) be a maximum matching of graph \(G\) and \(W := \{u, v | \{u, v\} \in M\}\). There is no such edge \(\{u, v\} \in E \setminus M\) satisfying that \(u\) and \(v\) both in \(V \setminus W\), otherwise \(\{u, v\}\) should be in \(M\). Therefore there are two types of edges in \(E \setminus M\):
  
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item \(\{u, v\}\) which \(u, v\) are all \(\in W\)
  	\item \(\{u, v\}\) which only one of \(u\) and \(v\) \(\in W\)
  \end{itemize}

	So, \(W\) is a vertex cover, and \(|W| = 2\nu(G)\), hence \(\tau(G) \leq |W| \leq 2\nu(G)\).
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}{3}
	\statement
     Show that $\tau(G) \leq 2\, \opt(\textrm{VCLP}(G))$ for all graphs $G$ (including non-bipartite graphs).
  
    \solution
    
\end{problem}




\begin{problem}{4}
	\statement
    For a graph $G=(V, E),$ let $\tau(G)$ denote the size of a minimum vertex cover, and $\nu(G)$ the size of a maximum matching. Recall the two linear programs VCLP and MLP (see above). Let $\tau_{f}(G):=\operatorname{opt}(\mathrm{VCLP}(G))$ and $\nu_{f}(G):=\operatorname{opt}(\operatorname{MLP}(G)) .$ Note that
		\[
		\nu(G) \leq \nu_{f}(G)=\tau_{f}(G) \leq \tau(G)
		\]
		where the equality in the middle follows from Strong LP Duality. Also, if $G$ is bipartite, then equality holds throughout in (1). Let us say a graph $G$ is $V C L P$ exact if $\tau(G)=\tau_{f}(G),$ and $M L P$ exact if $\nu(G)=\nu_{f}(G) .$ As we already know, a bipartite graph $G$ is both VCLP exact and MLP exact. From now on, suppose that $G$ is not bipartite but $\tau(G)=\tau_{f}(G)$
		
		1. Give an example of such a graph $G$ that is not bipartite but still VCLP exact.
		
		2. Give an example of a graph $G$ that is MLP exact but not VCLP exact.
		
		3. Suppose $G$ is VCLP exact. Let $Y \subseteq V(G)$ be a minimum vertex cover. Let $x$ be an optimal solution of $\operatorname{MLP}(G) .$ Show that $x_{e}=0$ if $e \subseteq Y$ (i.e., if both endpoints of $e$ are in the cover)
		
		4. Show that such a graph $G$ has a matching of size $|Y|$, and thus is MLP exact, too.
